' VB Versions : 5.0 / 6.0
'
' Requires    : cTimer.cls  ( Main Class Module )
'
' NOTE        : This module uses the Windows multimedia timer APIs to do a type of subclassing that requires
'               that you terminate this class module before exiting your program.  If you compile your program
'               and run it, you'll not have any problems and don't have to worry about this.  However, if
'               you're running in debug mode and click the STOP button, the class never gets properly terminated.
'               This will not crash your program or cause any problems directly, but to avoid possible problems
'               with timer events being left open, please close all the open forms in your project to end a
'               debug run instead of clicking the STOP button in Visual Basic.  This will process the class's
'               terminate event.
'
' Description : This class module was designed to take the place of VB's default Timer control.  Unlike the VB
'               standard Timer control, this class module does not require a form to run, allows for more
'               control of the timer,and is accurate down to 1 millisecond on most systems. ( the Min property
'               will return what your system's smallest possible time measurement is )
'
' SEE ALSO    : cTimer_NoSC.cls
'               ( This version of the Timer class module is the subclassing version.  cTimer_NoSC.cls is the
'               No Subclassing version )
'
' Example Use :
'
'  Private Timer1 As New cTimer
'
'  Private Sub Form_Load()
'    Set Timer1 = New cTimer
'    Timer1.Interval = 2000
'    Timer1.Enabled = True
'  End Sub
'
'  Private Sub Form_Click()
'    Debug.Print Timer1.TimeElapsed
'  End Sub
'
'  * IMPORTANT - PUT TIMER RELATED FUNCTIONALITY IN THE TimeProc FUNCTION
